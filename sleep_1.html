            How important is sleep really?  It is, in fact, so important that no one can live well without sleep.  Scientists haven’t yet fully discovered why we need sleep, but they do know that whilst we sleep, our body restores itself physically and the brain uses this time to organise and process thoughts.  What we all know from having probably experienced lack of sleep at least once, is how our concentration and mood were severely affected.  We were probably feeling more forgetful, irritable and maybe even more depressed.  So what can we do to make sure we get the most out of our sleep?

        <div class="tvheaditem">
            <p class="tvitem">
                Why don't I feel like I’m getting enough sleep?

            On average, adults require 8-9 hours of sleep.  Unfortunately for some of us, this is more easily said than done.  Below are a few reasons why our sleep quality might be reduced.  If any of these concern you, please speak to your doctor or pharmacist.

            There are many misconceptions about sleep.  Below are just a few along with a brief explanation why they are false.

                </legend>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        False. Getting less sleep can build up a sleep debt which can affect your daily function
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </fieldset>

                    Sleeping in on the weekend mean less sleep is required the following week.
                </legend>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        False. Sleeping-in only pays back your sleep debt.  Extra sleep cannot be stored up.

                    <li>
                        False.  Daytime sleepiness may be an indication of an underlying medical condition which will only improve with treatment.

                    <li>
                        False.  Naps are not necessary if you have had good sleep at night but they can be beneficial if you had a poor night's sleep

                    <li>

            Falling asleep is not an on and off button.  However, we can create the optimum environment for sleep to overtake us.  This is known as sleep hygiene.  Below are just a few examples.

                <li>	Insomnia is when it is hard to get to sleep or stay asleep, poor quality of sleep or lack of refreshing sleep</li>
                <li>	Snoring can worsen with age and weight gain, and can also disturb the partner’s sleep.</li>
                <li>	Obstructive sleep apnoea involves various periods throughout the night when the sleeper has trouble breathing which results them arousing briefly from their sleep.</li>
                <li>	Restless legs syndrome manifests as an uncomfortable feeling in the legs that is only stopped when the legs are moved.  </li>
                <li>	Bruxism is the grinding of teeth during sleep.</li>

            Improving sleep hygiene is recommended before any medications and vitamins.  Any medications to assist with sleep should only be used short-term as it does not address the underlying cause of sleeplessness.  Speak to your doctor or pharmacist for options that might suit you.

            Below are some vitamins that may assist with improving sleep.  Always speak to your doctor or pharmacist before commencing any vitamin products and if your symptoms persist.
