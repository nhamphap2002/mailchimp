                Did you know that 80% of blindness and vision loss is caused by 5 eye conditions?  One of these is Aged-Related Macular Degeneration.  To understand what Macular Degeneration is, we must first take a look at our eyes and see how the eye provides vision.

                The basis of how we can see objects is due to the reflection of light off the object.  This reflected light enters the eye through the cornea, passes through the pupil and lens before reaching the retina.  The retina then converts these light signals into nerve impulses to be sent to the brain for interpretation.  In macular degeneration, the focus is on a particular area of the retina known as the macula which is responsible for central vision.

            </div>
            <p>
                Macular Degeneration is a degenerative condition of the retina that causes progressive, painless loss of central vision.  This ultimately affects the individual’s ability to see fine detail, impacts daily activities and can even impact the ability to recognise faces.

            <p>
                As with all systems in our body, there must be a mechanism for transporting oxygen, sugar and other essentials into the eye and removing waste products from the eye.  This occurs in a layer of cells underneath the retina known as the Retinal Pigment Epithelium. The problem in macular degeneration is the inability for waste products to be removed from the retina.  This results in the depositing and build-up of waste products in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium and can be seen as yellow spots by optometrists.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early stages when these deposits first appear, vision may not be affected.  Vision loss begins when cells in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium begin to die or fail to prevent blood vessels from growing into the retina.  As such, it is important to have your eyes checked by optometrists regularly, particularly if you are at risk.

                Your doctor or an optometrist may have the equipment to examine the retina and diagnose macular degeneration.  The earlier it is detected, the earlier actions can be taken to slow its progress.  If you have any of the below symptoms, speak to your doctor or optometrist about having an eye examination.

                    Whilst genetics and age cannot be changed, there are a few things that can be done to reduce the risk or slow down the progress of developing macular degeneration.  Below are a few examples.
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li>
                        1.	Have regular eye tests ensuring the macula is checked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2.	Maintain a healthy lifestyle – don’t smoke, maintain healthy weight, exercise regularly, eat a healthy well-balanced diet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3.	Ensure you protect your eyes from sunlight exposure by wearing appropriate sunglasses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4.	Consider a suitable supplement.  Below are a few examples.

                Currently there are no cures for macular degeneration but studies have shown that zinc and antioxidants may slow down the progress.  The treatments available depends on whether you have dry or wet macular degeneration.  It is best to discuss your options with an eye specialist.

                It is important that anyone with macular degeneration receives support to maintain their quality of life and independence.  Below are some ways in which this can be achieved.

            <p>
                If you are concerned about your vision and are uncertain about whether you are at risk of macular degeneration, ask your doctor or optometrist for an eye test sooner rather than later, and take measures to minimise your risk of developing macular degeneration.  We rely so much on our vision that often we don’t realise just what our vision brings us until it’s too late.  As Dr Kerry Boytell, winner of 2014 mEYE World Photographic Competition stated when he snapped a rare picture of a snow leopard in its natural environment, “Our sight is precious, and being able to see nature in its glory is indeed wonderful.”
